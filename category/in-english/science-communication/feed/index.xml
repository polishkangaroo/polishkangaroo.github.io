				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>An article by Peter Hughes in <a href="http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/news/14420894.Can_science_save_football__Boffins_believe_they_can_make_the_beautiful_game_more_beautiful/">The Oxford Times</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AS 33,000 Oxford United fans packed the stands at Wembley this month, many were praying for victory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But a football-mad Oxford scientist has suggested that loving the beautiful game is more of a science than a religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Science Oxford&#8217;s creative director Quentin Cooper joined a panel of footie-loving celebrity scientists to debate how scientific improvements could make the beautiful game even more beautiful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a talk called &#8220;Can Science Save Football?&#8221; at The Old Fire Station on March 31, the experts discussed corruption, injustice and big money in football, revealing how a scientific approach could make things better.</p>
<div class="advert-container tiny" style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<p><span id="more-1394"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mr Cooper, a veteran science journalist and Manchester City fan, was joined by Oxford University Professor for the Public Understanding of Science Marcus du Sautoy, Radio 4 science presenter Jim Al-Khalili, University of Reading zoologist Joanna Bagniewska and University of Cambridge statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The panel discussed putting microchips into players&#8217; kit to track who last touched the ball, using smart phones for better crowd safety, and generating data to inform fairness in the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mr Cooper, who lives in Princes Risborough, said: &#8220;Fans love to moan, but if we have a problem let’s think about how we can solve it: that’s what science does.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So the question is: can we apply a bit of mind power to make the game fairer?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mr Cooper said the goal of science to make the world a better place could be just as productive on the football pitch as in a laboratory trying to cure cancer or send astronauts to Mars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He added: &#8220;There’s lots of football fans out there who feel like the game has fallen a bit into disarray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Science is trying to make the world a better place and solve problems, so maybe a scientific approach can help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The weird thing is that some people say they’re not interested in science, but whatever they are into there will be an element of science to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whether it’s football, knitting, gardening or whatever, I defy you to come up with any subject that doesn’t have a scientific element.</p>
<div class="advert-container tiny" style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;People think they don’t like science, but secretly they do.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mr Cooper insisted that many scientists like him shared a love of football and sports as well as their professional pursuits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He added: &#8220;That’s not the public perception of science, but we&#8217;re people too. We may be very logical about our research but we can still be potty about football.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been to a game with Marcus du Sautoy &#8211; he’s not just sitting there thinking about numbers, he’s up and shouting in the stands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Lots of scientists are very passionate about the game.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>My post for the <a href="http://crastina.se/june_2015/">Crastina Column</a></em></p>
<p><img src="http://crastina.se/wp-content/themes/magazine-pro/images/post-template-column-header.png" alt="The Crastina Column" /></p>
<p><strong>For many years Poland has experienced human capital flight, or “brain drain”. But this process is slowly becoming balanced by ”returnees”. The networking and communication skills of young members of the Polish scientific diaspora has played a crucial role. Joanna Bagniewska, zoologist and science disseminator, explains how.</strong><span id="more-1062"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1604" src="http://crastina.se/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/joanna-300x300.jpg" alt="joanna" width="300" height="300" />Oxford University, crowds of scientists mingling during a poster session. Mathematicians get excited by animal migration, zoologists discuss nanotube properties with physicists, and biochemists talk about extrasolar planets. What brings researchers from these diverse fields together? What do they have in common? Surprisingly enough, it’s not their research topics or institutional affiliation – it’s their nationality. They all come from Poland, a country, which, like many others, is experiencing human capital flight, or “brain drain” – the migration of highly skilled, well-educated individuals in search of better opportunities.</p>
<p>Four years ago young Polish scientists from Oxford and Cambridge, aware of this problem, decided to start a conference strengthening the diaspora of Polish researchers, and their links with Poland.<em> <a href="http://www.polishperspectives.org/">Science: Polish Perspectives</a> </em>(or SPP for short) showcases top quality research, connects young Polish scientists working abroad, and discusses Poland’s future in science and technology. Each autumn 200 or so Polish scientists from all over Europe, most of them PhD students and postdocs, gather at either Oxford or Cambridge to listen to TED-style talks from a range of scientific disciplines. Apart from budding scientists there are also keynote speakers of notable grandeur, such as CERN’s President, Prof. Zalewska, or the leader of graphene growth research, Prof. Baranowski. The national focus gives the participants a sense of unity, although non-Poles are always welcome to attend as the event is held in English. In just four years SPP became not just a conference, but a community – of young, dynamic, outgoing researchers, passionate about their work and their roots.</p>
<p>The SPP format was picked up by Prof. Janusz Bujnicki of <a href="http://www.iimcb.gov.pl/">IIMCB</a>, a guest at SPP2014. He liked the idea so much, that he became the driving force behind <a href="http://www.polishscientificnetworks.pl/">Polish Scientific Networks</a>, SPP’s sister conference. This event, which will take place in Warsaw mid-June, aims to encourage Polish scientists working abroad to establish research groups in Poland, and to develop and foster collaborations between Poles from abroad and from the homeland. This is what Bujnicki calls “turning brain drain into brain circulation”.</p>
<p>Even though Poland has been slow to recognise the potential of its scientific diaspora, it recently unveiled several attractive grant programmes for “returnees” and foreigners, in the hope of drawing in excelling applicants and boosting the quality of Polish research. The SPP community, a centralised hub for Polish researchers abroad, can pinpoint their needs, while at the same time advertising the opportunities in the labs at home. Some Poles already chose to return – and while the differences in academic cultures don’t always make returns easy, these researchers will pave their way for others and form a support network. They will also draw on their previous connections to open Polish academia to more international projects. Hopefully soon we will witness a move from the source-sink model to a more bi-directional, horizontal exchange of ideas.</p>

<p>WILDLIFE conservation lecturer Dr Joanna Bagniewska has won a top award in the international final of a science communication competition.</p>
<p><span id="more-749"></span>Joanna, of Nottingham Trent University, won the International Alumni Award at the FameLab 2014 International Final for her talk on &#8216;bomber bees&#8217;, which explored how honeybees can be used to detect explosives and drugs.</p>
<p>FameLab International challenges researchers to present a topic to a non-specialist audience in just three minutes and is judged on content, clarity and charisma. The prize won by Joanna was voted for by FameLab alumni from previous years.</p>
<p>Joanna reached the international rounds after winning the national final in her native Poland.</p>
<p>She said: &#8220;I feel very proud of this award and am extremely pleased to have got as far as I did. The standard of the competitors was very high, so I did not expect to win an award, especially not such a prestigious one.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://jbagniewska.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/radley.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-408" src="http://jbagniewska.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/radley.png?w=500" alt="radley" width="500" height="308" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This year’s Radley and St Helen and St Katharine Conference on 13th November, followed last year’s successful ‘SmartTalks’ format: with five invited speakers talking for fifteen minutes each on a subject of their choice.<br />
<strong><br />
</strong>First off, was Radley’s Provocateur-in-Residence, James Delingpole, who opened the Conference with an entertaining, hard-hitting talk on ‘How to be a real Revolutionary’. James urged the many sixth-formers present not to follow slavishly set ideas they might encounter at university and in later life: “Just because an idea is fashionable does not mean it is true.” He implored them not to feel ashamed or guilty because of their privileged education, but instead be grateful for it. James re-affirmed his belief that “Private education is one of the best things about this country.” He closed by using the example of the film, ‘The Matrix’, to encourage the audience to choose the more challenging path in life.<span id="more-407"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img src="http://www.radley.org.uk/userfiles/image/news/StHelensConference3.jpg" alt="James Delingpole with NJK" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next Speaker, Professor Maggie Snowling, is the first woman President of St John’s College, Oxford, a cognitive psychologist and noted expert on Dyslexia. Professor Snowling explored the issue, “What is Dyslexia?” reminding the audience that “print is everywhere”: extremely daunting if, like her own brother in the 1960s, one struggled to decipher it. She too addressed the issue of educational privilege: stressing the educational problems of language barriers in developing countries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nick Abbott, diplomat and Head of the ‘Syria Team’ for the Government’s Stabilisation Unit, spoke next. Nick took as his theme the fascinating issues of the changes in the Middle East over the past 25 years: using his own extensive experience to illustrate his argument. Saudi was quite an unknown entity in 1988, when he first visited, “unused to foreigners” – but now the Middle East itself is far more aware of the wider world. Nick focused on the issues of ‘knowledge’, ‘access’ and ‘transition’ and left the audience far more aware of the huge changes currently taking place in this region: stressing how inter-twined with the Middle East the UK was, with over 150,000 Britons residing in Dubai alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img src="http://www.radley.org.uk/userfiles/image/news/StHelensConference2.jpg" alt="Nick Abbott and Lt. Col Stephanie Jackman" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second morning session then featured Joanna Bagniewska, a lecturer in Wildlife Conservation at Nottingham Trent University, with a DPhil at Oxford’s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit. Joanna gave a fascinating talk on the little-known subject of how bees are being used in security matters to detect explosives and drugs. With their acute sense of smell, they could be trained to detect these substances and could be even more reliable than ‘sniffer dogs’. Joanna also outlined other possible uses of bees: for example, in the detection of dry rot in buildings and indeed in the detection of diseases in humans, like tuberculosis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was a truly enlightening talk: with every member of the audience spellbound by Dr Bagniewska’s account of how to train bees for these purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The final guest speaker was Lieutenant Colonel Stephanie Jackman who, after two tours in Afghanistan and Command of the Rear Operations Group at Catterick, is currently on the Staff in the Policy Branch of the Army Personnel Group. Lt Colonel Jackman again spoke enlighteningly about the issue of women soldiers serving in the front line as infantry: exploring the moral and practical objections and the difficulties this would pose. She stressed how women were already serving in front-line operations as medics and in logistics and concluded by stating that, whilst most women would not be suited to forward infantry operations, a small proportion certainly would be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img src="http://www.radley.org.uk/userfiles/image/news/StHelensConference4.jpg" alt="The Groups present" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There followed a stimulating Question-and-Answer session, with the panel answering questions on a number of related issues from the morning&#8217;s speeches.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img src="http://www.radley.org.uk/userfiles/image/news/StHelensConference5.jpg" alt="Joanna Bagniewska" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the afternoon sessions, the focus switched to the sixth-formers themselves. All of them, including a delegation from our partner school, Desborough, worked together in mixed groups, preparing five-minute presentations on set issues – ranging from ‘Traffic Jams’ to ‘Tobacco’, ‘Disease’ to ‘Car Deaths’. The idea was to give sixth-formers from all three schools, Radley, St Helen&#8217;s, Desborough, the chance to learn an essential skill: how to communicate a key point quickly. Six groups were shortlisted to the final round of talks in the Theatre, in front of the full audience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The winners were praised by the judge, James Delingpole, for preparing such “excellent talks in such a short space of time.” Presenters in the winning group, who spoke on the issue, “Milk is cheaper than Water” included Hugo Mayes and Edward Hamilton-Stubber.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Joanna’s talk entitled <strong>“Learning the ways of the animals” </strong>was given at the independently organized TED event in Warsaw on March 21. She spoke about invasive species: plants and animals brought outside of their native range that have had huge environmental, agricultural, and financial impacts on their new surroundings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-306"></span>Although the war against biological invasives is costly (in Europe estimated at €12 billion per year), Joanna pointed out a silver lining. Like any powerful enemy, the adaptable and resilient invasive species challenge us to change our thinking; they push us to develop new methods of “espionage”. She said: “To match our invaders’ versatility, we need to come up with novel technologies and new analytical techniques for measuring their behavior in the wild.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Joanna’s work on the invasive American mink in Europe helped her develop methodologies (based on miniaturized logging devices) that can be applied to a diversity of semi-aquatic animals. Such methods are not only crucial for learning more about minks themselves. They are important because animals dependent on or adapted to living in water can be found across most groups of mammals – and while some are invasive and may cause a serious threat to biodiversity, others are endangered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet, before any eradication or conservation action is undertaken, there is a pressing need to find out as much as possible about the behavior and ecology of a particular species, she told the audience. In turn methods developed for an invasive could also be applied in order to save an endangered animal. Despite invasives often posing a danger to local species they can definitely contribute a lot to our knowledge and understanding of different branches of science.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Joanna graduated from Jacobs University with a <a href="http://www.jacobs-university.de/undergraduate-programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BSc in Biology</a>; she later finished her MSc and DPhil at <a href="http://www.wildcru.org/">Oxford University’s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit</a>. Her doctoral thesis focused on using novel biotelemetric methods to investigate the behavioral patterns of free-living semi-aquatic animals. Her research interests include wildlife conservation, behavioral ecology, and the use of technological solutions in biology.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">WildCRU&#8217;s DPhil student, Joanna Bagniewska, was awarded the Acorn Ecology Best Student Presentation Prize at the recent Mammal Society Conference. There were a number of great talks at the event but Joanna&#8217;s presentation on the diving patterns of semi-aquatic, shallow-diving, small-bodied mammals was unanimously chosen as the winner.  The head of the voting committee, Sue Searle from Acorn Ecology, said that Joanna&#8217;s presentation was not only informative and engaging, but also had the extra &#8220;spark&#8221; that the jury was looking for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Joanna was presenting WildCRU&#8217;s research on American mink using miniaturised Time-Depth Recorders (TDRs), tiny devices which measure temperature and pressure over time.  Using TDRs allows a precise determination of the diving behaviour of mink, as well as the examination of their activity patterns.  The methods explored by Joanna and her colleagues can also be used in measuring the activity of other semi-aquatic mammals.</p>
