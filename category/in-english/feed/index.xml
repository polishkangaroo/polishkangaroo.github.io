<aside class="grid-two content-share"><strong>A dangerous fungus has been sweeping across North America with devastating consequences. In the past decade, between 5m and 7m bats in the US and Canada have been wiped out as a result of the fungal disease known as white nose syndrome, which alters their behaviour in potentially deadly ways. But the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02441-z">latest research</a> shows there might be hope for researchers trying to battle the disease, following the discovery that UV light appears to destroy the fungus’s DNA.</strong></aside>
<aside></aside>
</div>
<div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body">
<p>White nose syndrome is caused by the fungus <em>Pseudogymnoascus destructans</em>, which grows on the bats’ muzzles (hence the name) and other hairless body parts including wings, and <a href="https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7007-8-135">causes skin lesions</a>. <em>P. destructans</em> is psychrophilic, meaning it thrives in cold temperatures between 4℃ and 20℃. This means it affects bats during hibernation.</p>
<p><span id="more-1781"></span></p>
<p>The itchy, painful lesions cause infected bats to repeatedly wake from hibernation, leaving them confused and causing them to display <a href="http://www.batcon.org/our-work/regions/contact-bci/usa-canada/white-nose-syndrome">highly unusual behavior</a>, such as flying outside during daylight in nearly freezing temperatures. The cold, lack of food and abnormal activity leads to bats depleting their winter fat reserves, and starving, dehydrating or freezing to death. As a result, the disease can kill between <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2010/100113/full/463144a.html">90% and 100%</a> of bats in affected hibernating colonies.</p>
<p>Out of the 47 bat species native to the US and Canada, over half rely on hibernation for survival. <a href="https://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/about/bats-affected-wns">Nine of these species</a> (including two endangered and one threatened) already show symptoms of white nose syndrome. <em>P. destructans</em> has also been found in another six species (including one endangered) that don’t yet show symptoms. The little brown bat (<em>Myotis lucifugus</em>), once the most common bat in North America, is now predicted to face <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/329/5992/679">regional extinction</a>.</p>
<p>Bats normally live a long time and produce only a single pup each year, so affected species are unlikely to recover quickly. Not only is this bad for biodiversity, but it could also have a serious economic impact on humans. In temperate regions, bats eat up to 600 insects a night and so provide a vital pest-control service for North American farmers, effectively worth <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/41">US$3.7 billion a year</a>.</p>
<h5>How did this bat-astrophe come about?</h5>
<p><em>P. destructans</em> has probably co-existed with bats in Eurasia for <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02441-z">millions of years</a>. As a result, these bats have evolved defences against the fungus. So in this part of the world, despite the occasional mild outbreak of white nose syndrome, the disease <a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(11)00192-3">doesn’t significantly impact entire groups of bats</a>. But when <em>P. destructans</em> was introduced to the previously unexposed American bats, the effects were disastrous.</p>
<p>White nose syndrome was discovered in North America <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5911/227">in 2006</a>. We know that the fungus was most likely spread by human activity because the North American fungus is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982215000792">almost genetically identical</a> to some of the samples found in Europe. Also, bats don’t migrate between the two continents and some of the distances between contaminated caves in the US are longer than the flying range of affected bats. On top of that, the first reports of white nose syndrome came from a <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/16/8/10-0002_article">popular tourist cave near Albany, New York</a>. So the fungus probably spread via contaminated clothing and caving equipment from tourists visiting affected areas.</p>
<p>Since then, white nose syndrome has become one of the most severe wildlife diseases ever recorded. Yet there may literally be a light at the end of the tunnel. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02441-z">research team from the US Forest Service</a> has discovered that <em>P. destructans</em> is extremely sensitive to ultra-violet light, particularly to UV-C light that kills germs but doesn’t cause skin cancer. They found that moderate doses of UV-C light killed over 99% of the fungus, and that even low doses killed 85%.</p>
<p>The effect is so potent because UV light destroys the fungus’s DNA, and, unlike <a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-15-6">related fungi</a>, <em>P. destructans</em> can’t repair the damage. Further tests are on the way to check whether UV light causes any damage to the bats themselves. But the fact that UV-C light has already been used in treatments of <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2133.2008.08549.x/abstract;jsessionid=DACFFB496B5103A02CDAC89BD89CB96F.f01t02">other fungal infections</a> in mammals means the discovery is very promising.</p>
<p>Managing wildlife diseases can be difficult and expensive. Think of how hard it would be to apply fungicide skin cream to tens of thousands of bats hanging from the top of a cave. But shining a simple hand-held UV-C light source on them would be much easier. So this research could have huge implications for protecting North American bats.</p>

<p class="byline vcard" style="text-align:justify;"><em>My blog post on the <a href="https://www.eaie.org/blog/roles-women-stem/">European Association for International Education</a> site.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
</header>
<section class="entry-content cf">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><img class="image-block-center image-width-full" title="Expanding the roles of women in STEM" src="https://www.eaie.org/.imaging/mte/eaie/width-820-not-expanding/dam/images/blog-images/2017/2017-09-27.jpg/jcr:content/2017-09-27.jpg" alt="Expanding the roles of women in STEM" />The fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), have traditionally attracted more male than female scholars on all academic levels. The d</strong><strong>isparity of interests between genders can be seen as early as secondary school. The resulting trend is, unsurprisingly, reflected in university applications – STEM disciplines tend to be dominated by male applicants. Additionally, mobile studen</strong><strong>ts in STEM fields are far more likely to be male. Today’s blog, from scientist Joanna Bagniewska, explores the reasons female students lose interest in the STEM fields and shares some optimistic insight into how some organisations are working to address this trend. </strong><span id="more-12505"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Losing interest at an early age</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="https://www.accenture.com/gb-en/blogs/blogs-get-more-women-digital-careers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A study conducted in February this year</a> showed that female students report a significant dip in the enjoyment of STEM subjects as they enter teenage years: while half of surveyed girls aged 7-11 considered Maths and Computer Science enjoyable and fun, this proportion dropped to 31% and 36% respectively in respondents aged 11-14. The above finding is coupled with the fact that more than half of teachers (57%) and parents (52%) admit to having made gender stereotypes in relation to STEM.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At university level, even in STEM subjects with a high intake of female undergraduates, there is a concern with retention of students, and ensuring that they do not drop out at any stage of their career. While the number of women in subjects such as biological sciences is high at an undergraduate stage, the proportion decreases at each progression point – postgraduate, postdoctoral, lecturer – leaving very few females at the professorial level.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Institutional biases or individual burdens?</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many explanations have been put forward to account for this disproportion – including institutional biases, implicit and direct discrimination, lack of role models or lack of confidence in the women themselves. However, <a href="http://ftp.iza.org/dp10947.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research published in August</a> shows that women are in fact more resilient than one might expect. Factors such as high school academic preparation, faculty gender ratio, or performance in the core subjects appear to have an equal effect on males and females, in terms of the risk of switching majors. Stereotyping a field as ‘masculine’ also seems to have no profound effect on the women in it. However, while individual factors appear to have no effect, their combination – particularly low grades, gender composition of class and external stereotyping signals – is a strong enough hit to drive women to drop out. It might therefore be worth investigating the ways of making the external environment a bit more ‘female friendly’ on an institutional level.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Creating a female-friendly field</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One way of addressing gender inequality in British institutions is the <a href="http://www.ecu.ac.uk/equality-charters/athena-swan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Athena SWAN (Scientific Women’s Academic Network) charter.</a> Founded in 2005, it recognises and celebrates examples of good practice towards the advancement of gender equality in higher education and research. Some of the recognised actions include outreach and mentoring programmes, reducing bias in recruitment, devising flexible and part-time working schemes which ensure career progression or providing better access to childcare. Initially, the programme was limited to STEM subjects; currently it has expanded to include other disciplines.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, mobility schemes such as the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship</a> allow women to actively pursue an international career in science. Traditionally, the mobility of female researchers has been lower than that of their male peers, as the career progression of women has often been adjusted to accommodate the needs of the family. However currently, in dual-career households, it is often the higher-earning partner who dictates the mobility strategy. Providing financial independence and promoting equal pay leads female scientists towards a much more international professional life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are at a point in history when the tables are turning – women are finding themselves encouraged, supported, and are suddenly beginning to grasp at the opportunities that have thus far been less accessible to them. A diversity of backgrounds, beliefs and opinions is an important contribution to the development of any field – as is retaining the potential of highly qualified employees.</p>

<div id="intro" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In science, what difference does sex make? Dr. Joanna Bagniewska, ecologist, well-known science communicator and teaching fellow at the University of Reading, is here to explain.</strong></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div id="content">
<p style="text-align:justify;">I’m an ecologist – and ecologists talk about sex A LOT. We love to prod the underlying differences between sexes in different species. After all, why should we assume that males and females, which occupy different territories, have different diets and exhibit different behaviours, would be ecologically and evolutionarily identical?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, in the scientific articles in my field, the sex of study animals is reported on a regular basis. I was very surprised to find out, however, that this attitude is quite different in other disciplines, e.g. in biomedical research.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Until recently, in medical studies, female animals were treated simply as male animals with hormonal fluctuations. Such an oversimplification is, unfortunately, very often inappropriate and insufficient. Just last year a group of international researchers, led by scientists from McGill University, showed that when it comes to pain, not only is there a difference in tolerance and sensitivity between the sexes – there are also fundamental physiological differences in dealing with it. In rodents, the two sexes actually use <a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v18/n8/full/nn.4053.html" target="_blank">different immune cells</a> in the spinal cord to process the pain – T cells in females, and microglia in males. Yet, Jeffrey Mogil from McGill <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v535/n7611_supp/full/535S7a.html?WT.feed_name=subjects_neuroscience" target="_blank">reports</a> that only 3 out of 71 scientific articles published in the journal Pain in 2015 confirmed the use of experimental rodents of both sexes; almost 80% used only male animals. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763410001156" target="_blank">Research</a> from UC Berkeley, led by Annaliese Beery, also showed a strong male bias in mammalian research in eight out of ten biological fields, most prominently in neuroscience. The authors suggest that studies focused solely on one sex should clearly indicate it in article titles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a flip side of the coin, too – the sex of the researchers themselves. In 2014, a <a href="http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v11/n6/full/nmeth.2935.html" target="_blank">study</a> led by Robert Sorge, found that mice and rats used in experiments react differently to male and female researchers. When exposed to the scent of male humans, the rodents become very stressed – so much so, that such strong stress acts as an analgesic. What does it mean? Rodents (of both sexes) handled by male researchers may be less sensitive to pain, and, as a consequence, the sex of the experimenter may lead to differences in baselines in behavioural studies, on which further applied research is then founded. Unfortunately, most of the time the sex of the researcher is not reported in publications, making comparisons between studies difficult, if not impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Discoveries such as those mentioned above lead to questions about their future applicability: types of pain medicine developed, dosages trialled in pain studies, and relevance to human subjects. And while the American Congress has introduced the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2101" target="_blank">Research for All Act</a>, requiring National Institutes of Health to run clinical trials on both men and women (in… 2015!), there is still a lack of consideration for sex in study animals, primary cells, or even cell lines.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Luckily the idea of gendered innovation, where gender and sex are incorporated into research principles, has been gaining recognition – largely due to the work of <a href="http://discov-her.com/en/article/the-importance-of-gendered-innovations" target="_blank">Londa Schiebinger</a> of Stanford University. Thanks to this approach, it turned out that osteoporosis – historically considered a predominantly female disease – can have very serious consequences for males; conversely, heart disease is not just a male problem – but is diagnosed differently in females.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So… let’s talk about sex! Particularly in the context of good experimental design.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Like many foreign scientists in Britain, Joanna Bagniewska was devastated when Britons voted to leave the European Union. The biology lecturer, a Polish migrant who found Britain a welcoming place to build her academic career over a decade, is suddenly seeing her job security and research prospects up in the air.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I&#8217;m worried that after my current contract finishes, one of the prerequisites could be a permanent residence card,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to apply for EU grant money, but how much longer will it be available for?&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more-1661"></span></p>
<div class="ad-placeholder" style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Britain&#8217;s top universities have long been among the world&#8217;s most sought-after destinations for study and research, drawing the brightest minds from all corners of the globe. But since Britons voted in June to leave the 28-nation EU, many in the science community say the U.K. risks losing the money, the international influence — and crucially, the talent — to sustain that enviable position.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">More than one-tenth of research funding at British universities has come from the EU in recent years. Some fields — such as nanotechnology and cancer research — are more dependent on EU funding than others, according to a report by technology firm Digital Science. From 2007 to 2013, Britain received 8.8 billion euros ($9.4 billion) in direct EU investment in research.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bagniewska is not just anxious about herself — she&#8217;s upset for her students&#8217; future too, for the opportunities that both Britons and foreigners will likely miss out on when unfettered mobility between Britain and Europe can no longer be taken for granted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They were just getting excited about doing their masters and Ph.Ds in other countries. And then Brexit happened and they just got trampled,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scientists and researchers argue that being part of the EU has given British science a huge boost because it allows Britain to recruit the best talent across Europe and take part in important research collaborations and student exchanges without being constrained by national boundaries. The bloc&#8217;s freedom of movement means its 500 million people can live and work visa-free in any member state.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one knows yet what form Britain&#8217;s exit from the EU — commonly known as Brexit — is going to take, but immigration was a key issue for &#8220;Leave&#8221; voters. Many believe some limit should be put on the number of EU citizens moving to Britain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed to reassert control over British borders. She has offered no firm guarantees for the rights of Europeans already living in Britain, an uncertainty that weighs heavily over the 32,000 Europeans who make up 16 percent of the academic workforce in British universities. Many universities say the rhetoric over immigration control is also jeopardizing recruitment of researchers and students from further afield.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scientists for EU, an advocacy group, says it has received over 400 letters from researchers describing how Brexit has already impacted their life and work. Some are losing doctoral students who pulled out of studentships and job offers. Academics are putting plans to relocate to Britain on hold. One said their employer, a London university, immediately imposed a temporary hiring freeze, citing uncertainties about student recruitment and research income.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Adam Durrant, a British entrepreneur who founded an aerospace startup supplying climate data to airlines and aircraft manufacturers, says he&#8217;s now considering moving some of his business to a EU country outside of Britain. Part of the reason, he says, is that Brexit will likely make hiring the right people much harder than before.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;In the future, it probably means that people would be less interested to come to the U.K. to work,&#8221; said Durrant. &#8220;There&#8217;s a huge question mark over my company and my own personal future. I will certainly retain a U.K. presence, but my company&#8217;s focus of gravity may shift elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scientists say some U.K.-based researchers are already being excluded from joint bids for EU funding to minimize the risks for their colleagues.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Paul Crowther, head of physics and astronomy at the University of Sheffield, said a researcher from his department was dropped from an EU grant proposal as a precaution following the Brexit referendum. The vote &#8220;put the U.K.-based researchers in a very awkward position&#8221; and their participation in EU-funded programs could &#8220;compromise the project,&#8221; he was told.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The erosion of U.K. involvement in EU networks has already begun, with both the U.K. and EU science worse off,&#8221; Crowther said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Apart from a loss of grant money, Brexit will likely cause British scientists and research centers to miss out on shared databases and infrastructure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Large-scale efforts like studies of rare genetic diseases, the building of large facilities, are areas that multinational collaborations do much better,&#8221; said Venki Ramakrishnan, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist and president of Britain&#8217;s prestigious Royal Society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The EU is an important source of research funding for Britain, which lags behind many developed countries in state investment in science. In 2014, Britain&#8217;s government spent under 0.5 percent of its GDP on research — below the European average, and half that of South Korea.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May&#8217;s government is clearly aware of the jitters. She has promised to increase annual investment in research by 2 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) by 2020, in hopes her country can remain a world leader in science and innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Durrant is doubtful that&#8217;s enough to make a big difference.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Two billion a year spread across everything isn&#8217;t going to go very far,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similar anxieties are being felt at the undergraduate level. The 125,000 European students studying at British universities now pay the same fees as locals and have access to the same government loans. Officials have promised this will not change for those applying next year — but no one knows what will happen after that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fewer European students appeared to be applying for some of Britain&#8217;s most competitive university courses, including medicine and places at Oxford and Cambridge. In September, the admission service UCAS reported a 9 percent drop in EU applications for British undergraduate courses starting in 2017.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some argue that Britain could become like Switzerland, an &#8220;associate&#8221; EU state that is opting out of free movement of people while still taking part in limited European science projects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It&#8217;s not all doom and gloom — but it will be harder,&#8221; Ramakrishnan said. &#8220;We could make a go of it outside the EU. But for that to happen, we have to attract talent and fund science. And those two things are critical.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>My interview for the <a href="http://soapboxscience.org/?p=3321">Soapbox Science blog</a>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr Joanna Bagniewska is a zoologist working as a teaching fellow at <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/biologicalsciences/about/staff/j-m-bagniewska.aspx">Reading </a>University’s School of Biological Sciences. Her research interests encompass ecology and conservation biology, particularly the subject of invasive species. She is a very keen science communicator – she won FameLab Poland, gave a talk at TEDxWarsaw, and she even does science stand-up comedy.  Meet Joanna in our <a href="http://soapboxscience.org/?page_id=2560">Reading </a>event, where she’ll be discussing <em>“How Disney &amp; Science don’t always go hand in hand”.</em></p>
<div class="entry-content">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>SS: Joanna, how did you get to your current position?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">JB: While completing my undergraduate in Biology at Jacobs University in Bremen, Germany, I did an internship with the University of New South Wales. I spent two months in Australia’s Snowy Mountains examining road ecology – i.e. the impact of roads on the surrounding wildlife. I found the subject absolutely fascinating, and from that point onwards I knew that I wanted to research ecology and conservation biology. To get more international experience, I decided to spend a semester abroad at Rice University in Texas, where I obtained a lot of hands-on experience in herpetology and animal behaviour. After completing my undergraduate degree, I went on to obtain my MSc from Oxford University; my research focused on the methods used for monitoring South African canid species, such as jackals and foxes. I then stayed at Oxford for my doctorate, which examined the behavioural ecology of the American mink in the UK. After graduating, I worked for a start-up company for a few months, and then went on to be a lecturer at Nottingham Trent University. Eventually I moved back to West Midlands to take the post of a teaching fellow at Reading University’s School of Biological Sciences.</p>
<p><span id="more-1502"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>SS: What, or who, inspired you to get a career in science?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">JB: My earliest inspiration came from countless books on animals that I received from my parents when I was very little. I’ve always had very diverse interests, and up until the very end of high school I wasn’t sure what to study. I was torn between studying architecture (like my mother), Chinese language (because I lived in China for a few years) and animal science (because I really liked animals). Eventually I settled for biology, even though it was my weakest subject in school – mainly because I was very passionate about wildlife, but not any of the other aspects of the curriculum! Going to university was pretty much the default option in my family, but as I was the first one to choose a science degree, my parents were very apprehensive – they did not think that biology was a viable career choice. In fact, it was only when I went to South Africa with my students last year, my mother finally admitted “wow, you really do have the coolest job in the world”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>SS: What is the most fascinating aspect of your research/work?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">JB: There are several. Making sense of the world around us, interacting with animals, travelling, and finally meeting inspirational and passionate people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>SS: What attracted you to Soapbox Science in the first place?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">JB: Talking to people about what animals do is one of my favourite activities of all time. Well, that and ceilidhs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>SS: Sum up in one word your expectations for the day – excitement? Fear? Thrill? Anticipation?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">JB: Woohoo!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>SS: If you could change one thing about the scientific culture right now, what would it be?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">JB: The lack of stability. I understand that mobility is good for science, but I really don’t think it’s that good for scientists. We’re not science automatons – we’re people, we want to have relationships, start families, have a good night’s sleep without worrying about where our money will come from tomorrow. Continuous searches for funding, applying for grants, looking for jobs is what really sucks the fun out of science. Currently in some scientific circles revealing that you have a life outside of academia leads to, in the best case, a few funny looks, in the worst – being labelled a weak scientist.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>SS: What would be your top recommendation to a female PhD student considering pursuing a career in academia?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">JB: I have a dilemma here. The optimistic advice would be: believe in what you do, be kind to everyone, and build a supportive contact network around you. The truly heartfelt (although painful) advice would be: find a rich husband/wife, prepare for an extremely competitive environment with very little money to go around, and always have an escape plan. I know the second set sounds incredibly harsh, but when I look back at my academic career, I wish someone had given me a reality check like this – not to put me down, but to really allow me to prepare myself for any worst case scenarios.</p>

<p>Would you let a zoologist tell you the truth about the animals in Disney films? Warning: you might not be able to watch them in the same way ever again.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what The University of Reading&#8217;s Dr Joanna Bagniewska will be doing at a Soapbox Science event at Reading town centre next weekend.</p>
<p>She will be telling children how Baloo from The Jungle Book isn&#8217;t as cuddly as he seems, and that Simba and Nala from The Lion King could actually be brother and sister &#8211; yeah, our minds are blown too.</p>
<p>The talk titled, How Disney and Science don’t always go hand in hand, is just one of the events sharing weird and wonderful facts at the science takeover in Reading on Saturday, July 9.</p>
<p>Bringing together professors from an array of environmental fields, the aim of the day is to promote female scientists who will be talking to audiences about some of the projects and ideas they have worked on.</p>
<p>Following the format of London Hyde Park’s Speaker’s Corner, the talks will run from midday to 3pm in Broad Street outside Sainsbury&#8217;s.</p>
<h3>For now, take a look at these fascinating facts &#8211; just some of things you can discover on the day</h3>
<ol>
<li>Overflows of untreated sewage into the River Thames adds up to tens of millions of tonnes every year. Each year, enough sewage discharges into the River Thames to fill the Albert Hall 450 times over.</li>
<li>The levels of drug materials found in rivers are used to estimate the amount of drugs consumed in towns and cities.</li>
<li>Mammals with large brains are more vulnerable to extinction. Big brains may help humans, but are bad news for other mammals.</li>
<li>Palm oil is found in about 50 per cent of all packaged supermarket products, from your peanut butter to your soap.</li>
<li>14 out of the 18 different species of bat species found in the UK have been recorded in Berkshire and South Buckinghamshire.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>An article by Peter Hughes in <a href="http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/news/14420894.Can_science_save_football__Boffins_believe_they_can_make_the_beautiful_game_more_beautiful/">The Oxford Times</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AS 33,000 Oxford United fans packed the stands at Wembley this month, many were praying for victory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But a football-mad Oxford scientist has suggested that loving the beautiful game is more of a science than a religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Science Oxford&#8217;s creative director Quentin Cooper joined a panel of footie-loving celebrity scientists to debate how scientific improvements could make the beautiful game even more beautiful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a talk called &#8220;Can Science Save Football?&#8221; at The Old Fire Station on March 31, the experts discussed corruption, injustice and big money in football, revealing how a scientific approach could make things better.</p>
<div class="advert-container tiny" style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<p><span id="more-1394"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mr Cooper, a veteran science journalist and Manchester City fan, was joined by Oxford University Professor for the Public Understanding of Science Marcus du Sautoy, Radio 4 science presenter Jim Al-Khalili, University of Reading zoologist Joanna Bagniewska and University of Cambridge statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The panel discussed putting microchips into players&#8217; kit to track who last touched the ball, using smart phones for better crowd safety, and generating data to inform fairness in the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mr Cooper, who lives in Princes Risborough, said: &#8220;Fans love to moan, but if we have a problem let’s think about how we can solve it: that’s what science does.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So the question is: can we apply a bit of mind power to make the game fairer?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mr Cooper said the goal of science to make the world a better place could be just as productive on the football pitch as in a laboratory trying to cure cancer or send astronauts to Mars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He added: &#8220;There’s lots of football fans out there who feel like the game has fallen a bit into disarray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Science is trying to make the world a better place and solve problems, so maybe a scientific approach can help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The weird thing is that some people say they’re not interested in science, but whatever they are into there will be an element of science to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whether it’s football, knitting, gardening or whatever, I defy you to come up with any subject that doesn’t have a scientific element.</p>
<div class="advert-container tiny" style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;People think they don’t like science, but secretly they do.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mr Cooper insisted that many scientists like him shared a love of football and sports as well as their professional pursuits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He added: &#8220;That’s not the public perception of science, but we&#8217;re people too. We may be very logical about our research but we can still be potty about football.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been to a game with Marcus du Sautoy &#8211; he’s not just sitting there thinking about numbers, he’s up and shouting in the stands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Lots of scientists are very passionate about the game.&#8221;</p>
