<p>WILDLIFE conservation lecturer Dr Joanna Bagniewska has won a top award in the international final of a science communication competition.</p>
<p><span id="more-749"></span>Joanna, of Nottingham Trent University, won the International Alumni Award at the FameLab 2014 International Final for her talk on &#8216;bomber bees&#8217;, which explored how honeybees can be used to detect explosives and drugs.</p>
<p>FameLab International challenges researchers to present a topic to a non-specialist audience in just three minutes and is judged on content, clarity and charisma. The prize won by Joanna was voted for by FameLab alumni from previous years.</p>
<p>Joanna reached the international rounds after winning the national final in her native Poland.</p>
<p>She said: &#8220;I feel very proud of this award and am extremely pleased to have got as far as I did. The standard of the competitors was very high, so I did not expect to win an award, especially not such a prestigious one.&#8221;</p>
