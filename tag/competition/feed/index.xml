				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NOTTINGHAM Trent University academic Dr Joanna Bagniewska has made it into the international rounds of a science communication competition.</p>
<p><span id="more-669"></span>Joanna, a lecturer in wildlife conservation in the university&#8217;s School of Animal, Rural and Environmental Sciences, will compete against more than 25 other contestants after winning the national final of FameLab in her native Poland.</p>
<p>The event challenges researchers to present a topic in science, engineering or maths in an engaging way to a non-specialist audience in just three minutes.</p>
<p>Her topic was &#8220;The curious incident of testicles at night time&#8221;, examining the influence of the melatonin hormone on the physiology of humans and other animals.</p>
<p>FameLab aims to &#8220;find the new voice of science and engineering across the world&#8221;.</p>
<p>Joanna, who will be representing Poland in the international round, said: &#8220;I am very pleased with the result, particularly because I usually do not use Polish to talk science.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a challenge and a wonderful adventure, and I am looking forward to representing my country and Nottingham Trent University in the international rounds.&#8221;</p>

<p style="color:#4e4e4e;">An academic at Nottingham Trent University has made the international rounds of a science communication competition – which challenges researchers to present a topic to a non-specialist audience in just three minutes.<span id="more-655"></span></p>
<p style="color:#4e4e4e;">Dr Joanna Bagniewska, a lecturer in wildlife conservation in the University&#8217;s School of Animal, Rural and Environmental Sciences, will compete against more than 25 other contestants after winning the national final of &#8216;FameLab&#8217; in her native Poland.</p>
<p style="color:#4e4e4e;">Her topic was &#8216;The curious incident of testicles at night time&#8217;, examining the influence of the melatonin hormone on the physiology of humans and other animals.</p>
<p style="color:#4e4e4e;">FameLab aims to &#8216;find the new voice of science and engineering across the world&#8217;.</p>
<p style="color:#4e4e4e;">Contestants have just three minutes to present a topic in science, engineering or maths in an engaging way – without PowerPoint and with limited props &#8211; and judges are looking for those who shine in content, clarity and charisma.</p>
<p style="color:#4e4e4e;">Joanna, who will be representing Poland in the international round, said: &#8220;I am very pleased with the result, particularly because I usually do not use Polish to &#8216;talk science&#8217;.</p>
<p style="color:#4e4e4e;">&#8220;It&#8217;s been a challenge and a wonderful adventure, and I am looking forward to representing my country and Nottingham Trent University in the international rounds.&#8221;</p>
<p style="color:#4e4e4e;">The international rounds will take place on 5 June at The Times Cheltenham Science Festival.</p>
