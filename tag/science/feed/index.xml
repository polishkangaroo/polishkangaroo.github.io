<div class="articleBody">
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like many foreign scientists in Britain, Joanna Bagniewska was devastated when Britons voted to leave the European Union. The biology lecturer, a Polish migrant who found Britain a welcoming place to build her academic career over a decade, is suddenly seeing her job security and research prospects up in the air.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I&#8217;m worried that after my current contract finishes, one of the prerequisites could be a permanent residence card,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to apply for EU grant money, but how much longer will it be available for?&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more-1661"></span></p>
<div class="ad-placeholder" style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Britain&#8217;s top universities have long been among the world&#8217;s most sought-after destinations for study and research, drawing the brightest minds from all corners of the globe. But since Britons voted in June to leave the 28-nation EU, many in the science community say the U.K. risks losing the money, the international influence — and crucially, the talent — to sustain that enviable position.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">More than one-tenth of research funding at British universities has come from the EU in recent years. Some fields — such as nanotechnology and cancer research — are more dependent on EU funding than others, according to a report by technology firm Digital Science. From 2007 to 2013, Britain received 8.8 billion euros ($9.4 billion) in direct EU investment in research.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bagniewska is not just anxious about herself — she&#8217;s upset for her students&#8217; future too, for the opportunities that both Britons and foreigners will likely miss out on when unfettered mobility between Britain and Europe can no longer be taken for granted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They were just getting excited about doing their masters and Ph.Ds in other countries. And then Brexit happened and they just got trampled,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scientists and researchers argue that being part of the EU has given British science a huge boost because it allows Britain to recruit the best talent across Europe and take part in important research collaborations and student exchanges without being constrained by national boundaries. The bloc&#8217;s freedom of movement means its 500 million people can live and work visa-free in any member state.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one knows yet what form Britain&#8217;s exit from the EU — commonly known as Brexit — is going to take, but immigration was a key issue for &#8220;Leave&#8221; voters. Many believe some limit should be put on the number of EU citizens moving to Britain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed to reassert control over British borders. She has offered no firm guarantees for the rights of Europeans already living in Britain, an uncertainty that weighs heavily over the 32,000 Europeans who make up 16 percent of the academic workforce in British universities. Many universities say the rhetoric over immigration control is also jeopardizing recruitment of researchers and students from further afield.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scientists for EU, an advocacy group, says it has received over 400 letters from researchers describing how Brexit has already impacted their life and work. Some are losing doctoral students who pulled out of studentships and job offers. Academics are putting plans to relocate to Britain on hold. One said their employer, a London university, immediately imposed a temporary hiring freeze, citing uncertainties about student recruitment and research income.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Adam Durrant, a British entrepreneur who founded an aerospace startup supplying climate data to airlines and aircraft manufacturers, says he&#8217;s now considering moving some of his business to a EU country outside of Britain. Part of the reason, he says, is that Brexit will likely make hiring the right people much harder than before.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;In the future, it probably means that people would be less interested to come to the U.K. to work,&#8221; said Durrant. &#8220;There&#8217;s a huge question mark over my company and my own personal future. I will certainly retain a U.K. presence, but my company&#8217;s focus of gravity may shift elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scientists say some U.K.-based researchers are already being excluded from joint bids for EU funding to minimize the risks for their colleagues.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Paul Crowther, head of physics and astronomy at the University of Sheffield, said a researcher from his department was dropped from an EU grant proposal as a precaution following the Brexit referendum. The vote &#8220;put the U.K.-based researchers in a very awkward position&#8221; and their participation in EU-funded programs could &#8220;compromise the project,&#8221; he was told.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The erosion of U.K. involvement in EU networks has already begun, with both the U.K. and EU science worse off,&#8221; Crowther said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Apart from a loss of grant money, Brexit will likely cause British scientists and research centers to miss out on shared databases and infrastructure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Large-scale efforts like studies of rare genetic diseases, the building of large facilities, are areas that multinational collaborations do much better,&#8221; said Venki Ramakrishnan, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist and president of Britain&#8217;s prestigious Royal Society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The EU is an important source of research funding for Britain, which lags behind many developed countries in state investment in science. In 2014, Britain&#8217;s government spent under 0.5 percent of its GDP on research — below the European average, and half that of South Korea.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May&#8217;s government is clearly aware of the jitters. She has promised to increase annual investment in research by 2 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) by 2020, in hopes her country can remain a world leader in science and innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Durrant is doubtful that&#8217;s enough to make a big difference.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Two billion a year spread across everything isn&#8217;t going to go very far,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similar anxieties are being felt at the undergraduate level. The 125,000 European students studying at British universities now pay the same fees as locals and have access to the same government loans. Officials have promised this will not change for those applying next year — but no one knows what will happen after that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fewer European students appeared to be applying for some of Britain&#8217;s most competitive university courses, including medicine and places at Oxford and Cambridge. In September, the admission service UCAS reported a 9 percent drop in EU applications for British undergraduate courses starting in 2017.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some argue that Britain could become like Switzerland, an &#8220;associate&#8221; EU state that is opting out of free movement of people while still taking part in limited European science projects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It&#8217;s not all doom and gloom — but it will be harder,&#8221; Ramakrishnan said. &#8220;We could make a go of it outside the EU. But for that to happen, we have to attract talent and fund science. And those two things are critical.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>My interview for the <a href="http://soapboxscience.org/?p=3321">Soapbox Science blog</a>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr Joanna Bagniewska is a zoologist working as a teaching fellow at <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/biologicalsciences/about/staff/j-m-bagniewska.aspx">Reading </a>University’s School of Biological Sciences. Her research interests encompass ecology and conservation biology, particularly the subject of invasive species. She is a very keen science communicator – she won FameLab Poland, gave a talk at TEDxWarsaw, and she even does science stand-up comedy.  Meet Joanna in our <a href="http://soapboxscience.org/?page_id=2560">Reading </a>event, where she’ll be discussing <em>“How Disney &amp; Science don’t always go hand in hand”.</em></p>
<div class="entry-content">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>SS: Joanna, how did you get to your current position?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">JB: While completing my undergraduate in Biology at Jacobs University in Bremen, Germany, I did an internship with the University of New South Wales. I spent two months in Australia’s Snowy Mountains examining road ecology – i.e. the impact of roads on the surrounding wildlife. I found the subject absolutely fascinating, and from that point onwards I knew that I wanted to research ecology and conservation biology. To get more international experience, I decided to spend a semester abroad at Rice University in Texas, where I obtained a lot of hands-on experience in herpetology and animal behaviour. After completing my undergraduate degree, I went on to obtain my MSc from Oxford University; my research focused on the methods used for monitoring South African canid species, such as jackals and foxes. I then stayed at Oxford for my doctorate, which examined the behavioural ecology of the American mink in the UK. After graduating, I worked for a start-up company for a few months, and then went on to be a lecturer at Nottingham Trent University. Eventually I moved back to West Midlands to take the post of a teaching fellow at Reading University’s School of Biological Sciences.</p>
<p><span id="more-1502"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>SS: What, or who, inspired you to get a career in science?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">JB: My earliest inspiration came from countless books on animals that I received from my parents when I was very little. I’ve always had very diverse interests, and up until the very end of high school I wasn’t sure what to study. I was torn between studying architecture (like my mother), Chinese language (because I lived in China for a few years) and animal science (because I really liked animals). Eventually I settled for biology, even though it was my weakest subject in school – mainly because I was very passionate about wildlife, but not any of the other aspects of the curriculum! Going to university was pretty much the default option in my family, but as I was the first one to choose a science degree, my parents were very apprehensive – they did not think that biology was a viable career choice. In fact, it was only when I went to South Africa with my students last year, my mother finally admitted “wow, you really do have the coolest job in the world”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>SS: What is the most fascinating aspect of your research/work?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">JB: There are several. Making sense of the world around us, interacting with animals, travelling, and finally meeting inspirational and passionate people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>SS: What attracted you to Soapbox Science in the first place?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">JB: Talking to people about what animals do is one of my favourite activities of all time. Well, that and ceilidhs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>SS: Sum up in one word your expectations for the day – excitement? Fear? Thrill? Anticipation?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">JB: Woohoo!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>SS: If you could change one thing about the scientific culture right now, what would it be?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">JB: The lack of stability. I understand that mobility is good for science, but I really don’t think it’s that good for scientists. We’re not science automatons – we’re people, we want to have relationships, start families, have a good night’s sleep without worrying about where our money will come from tomorrow. Continuous searches for funding, applying for grants, looking for jobs is what really sucks the fun out of science. Currently in some scientific circles revealing that you have a life outside of academia leads to, in the best case, a few funny looks, in the worst – being labelled a weak scientist.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>SS: What would be your top recommendation to a female PhD student considering pursuing a career in academia?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">JB: I have a dilemma here. The optimistic advice would be: believe in what you do, be kind to everyone, and build a supportive contact network around you. The truly heartfelt (although painful) advice would be: find a rich husband/wife, prepare for an extremely competitive environment with very little money to go around, and always have an escape plan. I know the second set sounds incredibly harsh, but when I look back at my academic career, I wish someone had given me a reality check like this – not to put me down, but to really allow me to prepare myself for any worst case scenarios.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>An article by Peter Hughes in <a href="http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/news/14420894.Can_science_save_football__Boffins_believe_they_can_make_the_beautiful_game_more_beautiful/">The Oxford Times</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AS 33,000 Oxford United fans packed the stands at Wembley this month, many were praying for victory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But a football-mad Oxford scientist has suggested that loving the beautiful game is more of a science than a religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Science Oxford&#8217;s creative director Quentin Cooper joined a panel of footie-loving celebrity scientists to debate how scientific improvements could make the beautiful game even more beautiful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a talk called &#8220;Can Science Save Football?&#8221; at The Old Fire Station on March 31, the experts discussed corruption, injustice and big money in football, revealing how a scientific approach could make things better.</p>
<div class="advert-container tiny" style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<p><span id="more-1394"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mr Cooper, a veteran science journalist and Manchester City fan, was joined by Oxford University Professor for the Public Understanding of Science Marcus du Sautoy, Radio 4 science presenter Jim Al-Khalili, University of Reading zoologist Joanna Bagniewska and University of Cambridge statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The panel discussed putting microchips into players&#8217; kit to track who last touched the ball, using smart phones for better crowd safety, and generating data to inform fairness in the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mr Cooper, who lives in Princes Risborough, said: &#8220;Fans love to moan, but if we have a problem let’s think about how we can solve it: that’s what science does.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So the question is: can we apply a bit of mind power to make the game fairer?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mr Cooper said the goal of science to make the world a better place could be just as productive on the football pitch as in a laboratory trying to cure cancer or send astronauts to Mars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He added: &#8220;There’s lots of football fans out there who feel like the game has fallen a bit into disarray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Science is trying to make the world a better place and solve problems, so maybe a scientific approach can help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The weird thing is that some people say they’re not interested in science, but whatever they are into there will be an element of science to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whether it’s football, knitting, gardening or whatever, I defy you to come up with any subject that doesn’t have a scientific element.</p>
<div class="advert-container tiny" style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;People think they don’t like science, but secretly they do.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mr Cooper insisted that many scientists like him shared a love of football and sports as well as their professional pursuits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He added: &#8220;That’s not the public perception of science, but we&#8217;re people too. We may be very logical about our research but we can still be potty about football.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been to a game with Marcus du Sautoy &#8211; he’s not just sitting there thinking about numbers, he’s up and shouting in the stands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Lots of scientists are very passionate about the game.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Dr Joanna Bagniewska, a zoologist from Nottingham Trent University, will represent Poland during the international final of FameLab, a competition for young researchers.</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-598"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How to share the results of research that has taken months or even years to get done if you have only three minutes’ time? That’s no easy task, and one that many luminaries of science keep stumbling over, too. FameLab has raised delivering such ultrashort speeches to the level of art. The competition rewards the most charismatic young researchers who manage to thrill the audience while explaining their mission within 180 seconds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Staged for the first time in the UK in 2005, FameLab has now its national editions in over twenty countries across Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. This year’s was the third edition to be organized in Poland. Out of the seventy entrants who took part in the competition, three were named as the laureates.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We are used to presenting our research results to scientists during specialist conferences. But here we can try and learn to talk to laypeople, which for me is a very valuable experience,” Dr Joanna Bagniewska, the winner of the Polish edition of FameLab, told Poland.gov.pl. In early June she will travel to Cheltenham in the UK to represent Poland during the international final of the contest. “People should be able to understand what we do, working as we do for public money,” added Dr Bagniewska.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A University of Oxford graduate, Dr Bagniewska teaches ecology and biodiversity at Nottingham Trent University. One of her areas of interest is biotelemetry, or the observation of animals in their natural habitats; she has also examined bees’ ability to detect drugs. Entitled “A dark predicament. What dangers to men lurk at night?”, her presentation dealt with research showing that the large amount of melatonin, or sleep hormone, being produced at night make males’ testicles shrink. Although the research was done on hamsters, news of the potential threat to men soon travelled around the world. This went to show that results of tests on animals should be analysed with caution.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second prize went to Justyna Lesiak, a PhD student from Munich University. She talked about Clostridium, a genus of bacteria she has researched which could soon provide a cure for tumours that are resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Moreover, Justyna Lesiak was presented with special awards of the Minister of Science and Higher Education, and BASF Poland, as well as the audience award funded by the British Council, which co-organized the event.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third laureate, Tomasz Jakubek, is a chemist from the Jagiellonian University. His presentation discussed catalysts that lower combustion temperature, and thus eliminate harmful soot which is a by-product of coal burning. Tomasz Jakubek was also awarded two special prizes by BMW Group Poland and BASF.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This year’s edition of FameLab was dominated by biologists, chemists, and biotechnologists, whereas last year it was engineers, physicists and mathematicians who called the shots. We are happy to see more and more people with advanced scientific degrees send in their applications,” Paulina Butlewska of the Copernicus Science Centre’s Communication and Promotion Division, which co-organized FameLab, told Poland.gov.pl. She added that each edition was at a higher level than the previous one, with scientists being more adept at preparing themselves for the competition.</p>

<p><a href="http://jbagniewska.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/nature.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-582" src="http://jbagniewska.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/nature.png" alt="nature" width="500" height="376" /></a></p>
<p>When the organisers of the first Science Polish Perspetives conference (SPP) &#8211; held last year in Oxford &#8211; announced there was going to be a sequel, the expectations were running high. Those two autumn days spent in the neoclassical Magdalen Grove Auditorium, buzzing with popular science talks, panel discussions, poster sessions and social interactions, left the participants dizzy with excitement and gasping for more. If anyone had wondered whether the unusual concept of a conference bringing together scientists linked solely by a shared national background (but open to the whole English-speaking world) would succeed or not, the answer was a resounding yes.</p>
<p>This was largely thanks to the organisers, marshalling the tight conference schedule like air traffic controllers. It was two of these organisers, Magdalena Richter and Tomasz Cebo that took on the task of following this class act by bringing SPP to Cambridge in 2013, supported by a new team of enthusiastic Polish researchers Ewelina Gregolińska, Kinga Pławik, Ola Kołodziejczyk, Paweł Jaworski and Piotr Oleśkiewicz. In a fantastic feat of modern technology, the organising team managed to bring the whole event together without ever meeting in person until the day of the conference.</p>
<p>And so we are in Cambridge, the town of Wittgenstein and Hawking, with its quaint colleges, cobbled streets and an unimaginable abundance of relics of scientific history, from a bridge allegedly designed by Newton himself to the pub in which Watson and Crick celebrated the double helix. This well-preserved abundance is what makes places like Cambridge seem unreal, especially to a Polish mind, accustomed to mementos of the past being quickly wiped away in the course of a turbulent history.</p>
<p>The talks are short: 15 min for the students and 30 min for the keynote speakers, followed in both cases by a short question session. There are also panel discussions, lively and engaging, covering different aspects of the organisation of science in Poland, and workshops, a new addition to the programme. The overall standard of the student talks seems even higher than last year and most speakers put effort into making their presentations accessible and entertaining, veering away from the regular scientific format for specialised audiences and more akin to the TED lecture style. This supports the interdisciplinary approach of the conference in a very real sense, people from different disciplines actually being able to follow all of the talks and discuss them during the breaks. As for the topics, however, the speakers take no hostages, their subjects ranging from quantum mechanics to cellular trafficking to human memory. This is what makes SPP fascinating.</p>
<p>Unlike the students, the keynote speakers and most panellists come directly from Poland, consistent with one of the objectives of the conference being to bring together the best Polish junior scientists working abroad and the distinguished senior ones working back home. As the old-fashioned virtues of the older scientists are complemented by the enthusiasm of the young, the morale at the meeting is flying high.</p>
<p>Among the invited guests there are also representatives of Polish funding bodies and other organisations, as well as sponsors, the main one being the Warsaw office of Boston Consulting Group. The prizes for the most impressive student talks go to Agnieszka Lekawa-Raus (Cambridge), Michał Kępa (Edinburgh) and Joanna Bagniewska (Nottingham Trent), while Krzysztof Kozak (Cambridge), Jakub Bochiński (Open University) and Tomasz Augustynek (Leicester) are awarded for the best contributions to the poster session.</p>
<p>Like last year, and as with all good conferences, an equally important part of the conference happens outside of the lecture room over countless cups of tea or coffee, and even more glasses of wine. The formal dinner in Corpus Christi College is, not surprisingly, a huge success, and &#8211; the participants heading off afterwards to one of Cambridge clubs &#8211; is just a prelude to an evening of joyful celebration.</p>
<p>Science used to be considered something set apart, a unique type of activity completely neutral with respect to human considerations. However, since Thomas Kuhn&#8217;s consideration of the social impact of science, we have been aware that it is in many ways a human activity like any other. The personal aspects of research, and the interactions of those involved can be just as important for the resultant intellectual value as the what and how. With this realisation in mind, conferences such as this &#8211; where the scientists group together according to cultural and not just purely scientific criteria &#8211; are an exciting complement to the more usual academic conference crowds. This is a concept that has been strongly illustrated here at SPP 2013.</p>
